
# 🧠 Module 3: Python Programming Fundamentals 

This section presents essential control structures and programming constructs in Python, including conditional logic, iteration, user-defined functions, and object-oriented programming. Upon completion of this module, learners will be able to:

- Implement conditional and branching logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- Construct `for` and `while` loops for iterative processes.
- Define and invoke functions with fixed and variable arguments.
- Create and manipulate objects and classes.

### 🔁 Conditional Statements

Conditional structures control the flow of a program based on logical conditions. The `if` statement evaluates a Boolean expression and executes associated blocks accordingly.

#### Example:
```python
temperature = 22

if temperature > 25:
    print("It's hot today.")
else:
    print("The weather is pleasant.")

print("Check complete.")
```
`temperature > 25` evaluates to False

The else block is executed → prints 'The weather is pleasant.'

After the conditional structure, 'Check complete.' is printed unconditionally

✅ Output:
```
The weather is pleasant.
Check complete.
```

### 🔂 Loops

Python supports both for and while loops for repeated execution of code blocks.

#### `for` loop example:
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit.upper())
```
Each fruit name is printed in uppercase:

- 'APPLE'
- 'BANANA'
- 'CHERRY'

✅ Output:
```
APPLE
BANANA
CHERRY
```

#### `while` loop example:
```python
counter = 0

while counter < 3:
    print(f"Count: {counter}")
    counter += 1
```
This loop prints values from `counter = 0` to `counter = 2`

✅ Output:
```
Count: 0
Count: 1
Count: 2
```

### 🔧 Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code defined using the `def` keyword.

#### Example 1 – Global variable access:
```python
base = 5

def multiply(factor):
    return base * factor

result = multiply(4)
```
Here, `base` is accessed from the global scope.  
✅ `result = 20`

#### Example 2 – Variable-length arguments:
```python
def concatenate(*args):
    return ' '.join(args)
```
The `*args` parameter allows passing a variable number of string arguments.  
✅ `concatenate("Hello", "World")` returns `"Hello World"`  
✅ Function purpose: _Concatenate a variable number of strings_

#### Example 3 – Conditional return:
```python
def is_even(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
- Returns `True` if input is an even number
- Returns `False` otherwise  
✅ Example: `is_even(4)` returns `True`

### 🧱 Objects and Classes

Python supports object-oriented programming through the use of classes and objects.

#### Creating an object with parameters:
Assuming the class `Book` is defined as:
```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, year):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.year = year
```
✅ Valid ways to instantiate:
```python
Book("1984", "George Orwell", 1949)
Book(title="1984", author="George Orwell", year=1949)
Book(author="George Orwell", title="1984", year=1949)
```
❌ Incorrect (wrong order):
```python
Book(1949, "1984", "George Orwell")
```

#### Modifying an attribute:
```python
# To change the availability attribute, use:
book.checkout()
```
✅ Correct method: _Utilising the method `checkout()`_

---

### 🗃️ Working with Lists and Dictionaries

#### Sorting lists in-place:
```python
numbers = [7, 2, 9]
numbers.sort()
```
`.sort()` modifies the list directly  
✅ Correct: `numbers.sort()`

❌ Invalid:
- `sort(numbers)` (not defined)
- `sorted(numbers)` (returns a new list)
- `numbers.sorted()` (not a valid method)

#### Accessing dictionary keys:
```python
student = {'name': 'Alice', 'grade': 'A'}
keys = student.keys()
```
✅ Keys: `'name', 'grade'`
