# ðŸ§  Module 2: Python Data Structures

This module explores the fundamental data structures used in Python for storing and manipulating collections of data. Upon completing this section, you should be able to:

- Understand and apply tuples, lists, sets, and dictionaries.
- Differentiate between mutable and immutable data types.
- Perform basic operations on each data structure.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Tuples

A **tuple** is an immutable sequence type in Python. Once created, its elements cannot be changed.

```python
coordinates = (10.5, 20.3)
print(coordinates[1])  # Output: 20.3
```

- Tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.
- Indexing and slicing are supported.
- Tuples are often used to store fixed collections of items.

## ðŸ“‹ Lists

A **list** is a mutable sequence used to store a collection of items.

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana']
fruits.append('cherry')
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

- Lists are defined with square brackets `[]`.
- Elements can be added, removed, or modified.
- Methods include `.append()`, `.remove()`, `.insert()`, `.pop()`, and `.sort()`.

## ðŸ”˜ Sets

A **set** is an unordered collection of **unique** elements.

```python
colors = {'red', 'blue', 'green', 'red'}
print(colors)  # Output: {'red', 'blue', 'green'}
```

- Sets automatically eliminate duplicates.
- Defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.
- Support operations like union, intersection, difference:
  
```python
a = {1, 2, 3}
b = {3, 4, 5}
print(a & b)  # Output: {3}
```

---

## ðŸ§¾ Dictionaries

A **dictionary** is a key-value mapping structure.

```python
person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
print(person['age'])  # Output: 30
```

- Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers).
- Values can be any type.
- Common methods include `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.items()`, and `.get()`.

```python
print(person.get('name'))  # Output: Alice
```

## âœ… Summary

| Structure   | Ordered | Mutable | Duplicates | Syntax     |
|-------------|---------|---------|------------|------------|
| Tuple       | Yes     | No      | Yes        | `(a, b, c)`|
| List        | Yes     | Yes     | Yes        | `[a, b, c]`|
| Set         | No      | Yes     | No         | `{a, b, c}`|
| Dictionary  | No*     | Yes     | No (keys)  | `{'key': value}` |

> Note: As of Python 3.7+, dictionaries maintain insertion order.
