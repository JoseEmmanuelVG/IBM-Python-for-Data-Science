
# üß† Module 4: Working with Data in Python

This module introduces core techniques for interacting with data in Python, focusing on file I/O and DataFrame operations with Pandas. After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Read data from files using the `open()` function.
- Write and append data to files.
- Load datasets into Pandas.
- Manipulate and save data using Pandas.

### üìÇ Reading Files

Python‚Äôs built-in `open()` function can be used to read text files.

#### Example:
```python
with open("data_sample.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        print(line.strip())
```
This code opens the file `data_sample.txt` in read mode, reads all lines into a list, and prints each line without newline characters.

‚úÖ **Key Concept:** Use `"r"` mode to read from a file.

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Files

Files can be written to using `"w"` mode, which overwrites existing content or creates a new file.

#### Example:
```python
with open("log.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Session started\n")
    file.write("No errors found.\n")
```

‚úÖ **Key Concept:** `"w"` mode truncates the file and starts writing from scratch.

---

### ‚ûï Appending to Files

Appending content can be done using `"a"` mode, which preserves existing data and adds new content to the end of the file.

#### Example:
```python
with open("log.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Session ended successfully.\n")
```

‚úÖ **Key Concept:** `"a"` mode appends content to an existing file.

---

### üêº Loading Data with Pandas

The `pandas` library provides the `read_csv()` function to load structured data from CSV files into DataFrames.

#### Example:
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("employees.csv")
print(df.head(3))
```

This code reads a CSV file and prints the first three rows of the DataFrame.

‚úÖ **Key Concept:** `pd.read_csv()` is ideal for loading tabular data.

---

### üßÆ Working with and Saving Data

Once loaded, a DataFrame can be filtered, analyzed, and saved back to disk.

#### Example:
```python
filtered_df = df[df["department"] == "Sales"]
filtered_df.to_csv("sales_team.csv", index=False)
```

This code filters rows where the department is ‚ÄúSales‚Äù and saves them to a new CSV file.

‚úÖ **Key Concepts:**
- Boolean indexing enables filtering.
- `.to_csv()` saves a DataFrame to a CSV file.

---

These practices form the foundation for working with datasets in Python, including reading from and writing to text files, as well as efficiently handling structured data with Pandas.
